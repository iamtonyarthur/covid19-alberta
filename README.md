# COVID-19 Alberta 
## Analysis & Visualization of COVID-19 in Alberta, Canada

This Jupyter notebook provides analysis and visualization for COVID-19 cases in Alberta, Canada. The notebook is the file named [covid_alberta.ipynb](https://github.com/iamtonyarthur/covid19-alberta/blob/main/covid_alberta.ipynb).

The datasets used are from the Government of Canada's [COVID-19 daily epidemiology update](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html) and the Alberta Government's [COVID-19 Alberta statistics](https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm). The epidemiology update contains daily COVID-19 cases for the Canadian provinces and territories. The Alberta government dataset shows the daily COVID-19 cases by demography. All other analysis is done using the Government of Canada's daily epidemiology update data.

## How to use the Juypter notebook

The easiest way to use the notebook for free is via Google Colaboratory ("Colab" for short). 
1. Go to Colab at https://colab.research.google.com
2. Login to Colab using your Gmail account. 
3. In Colab, go to File and upload the notebook
4. Click Runtime and run all

You can also choose to upload and run the notebook on your local computer, AWS (Amazon SageMaker), or other environment.
